## What is Axolotl?

Axolotl is a virtual pet app which allows the user to own their very own virtual axolotl. The user needs to take care of their pet by tending to certain needs hourly, or daily. Consider this some sort of a test-tun for in case you were thinking of casually getting an Axolotl as a pet.

### Features

Features in the app include interactions such as:

- Giving your axolotl a name
- Feeding it on a daily basis
- Cleaning its tank
- Replacing the fitler for the water to stay fresh
- Changing reactions according to whether or not your axolotl's needs are being met
- An extra two options of giving more attention or keeping the tank water cool allows the user to form a "level-up" bond with their pet.
